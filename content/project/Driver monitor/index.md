This project aims to address the issue of monitoring and improving bus driver behavior to ensure the safety of passengers and other road users. To achieve this, we have developed a robust model using Inception v3 architecture, which utilizes surveillance bus videos gathered in Shanghai. By analyzing these videos, we are able to perceive bus drivers' behavior and detect any abnormal actions or patterns.

In addition, our system goes beyond traditional video analysis by incorporating spatio-temporal information obtained through OCR identification. This allows us to build a comprehensive safety monitoring system that not only detects abnormal behavior but also provides early warnings when necessary. This integration of spatial and temporal data further enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of our system.

To make our monitoring system easily accessible and user-friendly, we have developed a cloud-based platform. This platform utilizes html 5 technology, ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers. Through this platform, users can access real-time monitoring data and visualizations of bus driver driving behaviors. By providing this information in a clear and interactive manner, our platform enables better understanding and management of bus driver safety, ultimately leading to improved overall transportation safety.
