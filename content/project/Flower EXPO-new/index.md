This project actively responds to the national ecological construction slogan and aligns with the requirements of world-class ecological urban development. It combines the traffic conditions of key roads of the 2021 Flower EXPO and existing data analysis signal control optimization schemes. In the early stages, we gathered information and formulated a testing plan. Subsequently, on-site testing was conducted to collect real and detailed traffic condition data, and analyze road ecological indicators. We consulted experts to understand the current usage of the system. With the assistance of traffic police, we obtained SCATS raw data and conducted in-depth analysis, combined with simulation software, to evaluate the existing signal control schemes. Finally, we designed methods to optimize the signal control scheme and validated it using VISSIM simulation software.
