Working with Sustrans, this project centers around Hilsea Lines, forming part of a wider initiative by PCC to improve access to greenspace. PCC has commissioned Sustrans to investigate how access to Hilsea Lines can be improved, engaging community stakeholders and developing inclusive solutions for Hilsea Lines and its surrounding areas to create a continuous, holistic greenspace. Thie commission incorporates the following objectives:
•	Improve greenspace access and connectivity to northern and southern communities,
•	Be inclusive of surrounding residents,
•	Incorporate a variety of different activities and opportunities for users,
•	Highlight the area’s history and biodiversity,
•	Do the above in a timely and cost-effective manner. 


This project focuses on London Road and the western entrance to Hilsea Lines. In addition to addressing the objectives above, solutions will tackle the following:
•	Reduce severance and blight induced by London Road,
•	Improve western access to Hilsea Lines,
•	Improve long distance and public transport connections to the green-space, 
•	Enhance green infrastructure.


The study provided a set of short-term, 12-month proposals and three longer-term design packages to transform the area west of Hilsea Lines. The appraisal process was heavily informed by the baseline assessment and project vision and resulted in recommending that the People-Centred Space design be taken forward as the best strategic fit for Portsmouth. This designed outscored two promising proposals, highlighting the importance of people-centered interventions.
