This project focuses on analyzing the temporal and spatial punctuality distribution of high-speed rail (HSR) trains across the network, as well as the distribution of delayed times. Utilizing the actual operating data from January 2018, the analysis incorporates several components, including the interval running time, travel speed, and station stoppage time of train G1 from January 23rd to January 29th. Furthermore, it examines the departure/arrival punctuality rate and daily delay time distribution at Nanjing Station. Additionally, the operational status of the Shanghai-Nanjing section is assessed using point and line analysis, encompassing parameters such as train transaction quantity, punctuality rate, cumulative punctuality rate at each station, and a heatmap of station arrival time delays. By focusing on the running data from January 4th on the Nanjing South to Shanghai Hongqiao section, the project also identifies the causes and examines the performance of delays. Based on these analyses, recommendations for emergency handling and recovery processes are provided, along with valuable insights.
