This project aims to evaluate the performance of the No. 104 bus in Shanghai Jiading from September 6 to September 10, 2021. 


To begin, the GPS data of the bus was processed meticulously, involving data drift correction and conversion into space-time trajectories. And then, a comprehensive analysis of the bus's operation status was conducted, encompassing the examination of its operation track, vehicle utilization, and line operation index.


Furthermore, the operation of the bus sections was closely investigated. This entailed analyzing various factors such as section operation time, delay, stop time, station workshop time distance, and station passenger delay. The goal was to identify any operational inefficiencies or issues within specific sections of the bus route.


Based on the collected data and analysis, a summary of the problems found during the given period was compiled. Additionally, suggestions and recommendations were formulated to address these issues and enhance the overall operation and management of the Shanghai Jiading No. 104 bus. The insights may contribute to optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of this public transportation service.
