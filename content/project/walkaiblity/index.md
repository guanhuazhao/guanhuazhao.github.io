In the context of an aging population, there is an emerging imperative to design walkable communities catering to the elderly. Even in the cosmopolitan city of London, there is a conspicuous gap in investigations regarding how older citizens perceive walkability. It is worth noting that such perceptions critically shape their willingness to engage in walking activities.


The core research objective is to identify the determinants of walking behaviours and perceived walkability among seniors across various neighbourhoods in London, whilst also illuminating the relationship between them. A quantitative analysis was conducted on a sample size of 200 
elderly individuals in Ealing, London. Utilizing a modified version of the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale for British Seniors, both linear and logistic regression models were employed to decode the data.


The research confirms that the adapted NEWS is apt for assessing perceived walkability among seniors in London. It further demonstrates that socio-demographic factors and neighbourhood type, informed by Socio-Economic Status and Walkability, are critical in shaping their perceptions. As a consequential finding, it is evident that certain perceptions significantly influence the walking patterns of the elderly in studying area.
