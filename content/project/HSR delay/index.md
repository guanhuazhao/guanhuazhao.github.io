The punctuality rate is an important evaluation indicator for high-speed rail service quality, which is highly valued by railway operation and management departments. However, due to uncertainties such as equipment failures, unforeseen accidents, natural environment, and human errors, delays in high-speed train services frequently occur, seriously impacting passengers' travel arrangements and reducing the service quality of high-speed trains. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research on the factors affecting delays in high-speed train services. 


High-speed train failure records serve as the data source for obtaining factors affecting delays in high-speed train services, mainly recorded in natural language form. This record format is characterized by informality and randomness, leading to a significant number of ambiguous semantics in the signs of high-speed train delays, making it an urgent problem to extract the factors influencing delays from high-speed train failure records. In this study, based on high-speed train failure records from 2016 to March 2019, chi-square values are used to represent correlation knowledge, extracting topic-word distributions of delay terms and delay causal patterns. Then, a priori correlation knowledge-based LDA topic model is established to extract semantic-level features from high-speed train delay data. Finally, a fuzzy accident tree model for high-speed train delays is constructed, and the impact degree of delay factors on top events is determined through quantitative and qualitative analysis, revealing key factors influencing high-speed train delays and proposing effective measures and priority in reducing the punctuality rate of high-speed trains. The research findings of this study can provide theoretical support for the punctual and efficient operation of high-speed trains and train scheduling command, contribute to improving passenger satisfaction and the level of high-speed rail services, and promote the healthy and sustainable development of high-speed railways.
